## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] What are the constraints of (any type of) Heap?
- [x] What type of Data Structure might we use to implement a heap?
- [x] What is the formula for getting the left child of a Heap root node? Right child?
- [x] What is a Priority Queue?
- [x] What is an `XMLHttpRequest`?
- [x] What's the difference between the `DOMContentLoaded` and `load` event triggers?

## Study

### Algorithms

Heaps are a new type of tree that are extremely useful when implementing any type of _priority queue_. They are unique in that one very efficient way to implement them is with an array. They are especially efficient for extracting a min/max value from a set of data!
