## Today's Learning Goals:

- What is a base case in recursion? Why do we need one? _Do_ we always need one?
- What exactly is a Stack Overflow?
- Describe _direct_ and _indirect_ recursion
- What are the common HTTP methods? When are they used, and what do they accomplish? (This is a big one)
- In which phase does hoisting occur?
- What is the difference between function hoisting and variable hoisting?
- What is a state tree in the context of Redux?
- Why don't we want to modify (i.e. mutate) our redux state?
- What is a pure function? Impure function?
- Describe in detail what a redux reducer is. What makes it a pure function?

## Practice

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. If you haven't already, make these learning goals into Flash Cards. Practice for at least 30 minutes today.**

### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

* **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
* **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
* **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
