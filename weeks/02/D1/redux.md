### Misc
We'll be spending the next 8 days going over a video series created by Dan Abramov himself. The videos are all very short - only about 2 mins in length each. **Since you should already know how to use Redux, the main goal here is to gain a deeper understand of how Redux works.**
>**NB: For those who prefer to read, all of these videos have (very short) transcripts!**

* [Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) - "**Single Immutable State Tree**" through "**The Reducer Function**"
