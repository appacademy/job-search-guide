# W2D1

## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] What is a base case in recursion? Why do we need one? _Do_ we always need one?
- [x] What exactly is a Stack Overflow?
- [x] Describe _direct_ and _indirect_ recursion
- [x] What are the common HTTP methods? When are they used, and what do they accomplish? (This is a big one)
- [x] In which phase does hoisting occur?
- [x] What is the difference between function hoisting and variable hoisting?
- [x] What is a state tree in the context of Redux?
- [x] Why don't we want to modify (i.e. mutate) our redux state?
- [x] What is a pure function? Impure function?
- [x] Describe in detail what a redux reducer is. What makes it a pure function?

## Study

### Algorithms

Flashback to Week 1 Day 3 -- **_Recursion Day_**. See how far you've come? Now is time to gain an even deeper understanding of more advanced recursion concepts! You should plan to get through this reading over the next **_two_** days, in order for you to gain a thorough understanding of it. 

* [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)

### Web

You should be relatively familiar with HTTP methods (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, etc.) through your work with MVC frameworks. This article will unpack exactly what happens when each of these HTTP methods is used. 

Read: 

* [HTTP methods](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_methods.htm)

### JavaScript

* [Hoisting](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-definitive-javascript-handbook-for-a-developer-interview-44ffc6aeb54e)
* For the link above, search "Hoisting" and only study that section today.

### Misc
We'll be spending the next 8 days going over a video series created by Dan Abramov himself. The videos are all very short - only about 2 mins in length each. **Since you should already know how to use Redux, the main goal here is to gain a deeper understand of how Redux works.**
>**NB: For those who prefer to read, all of these videos have (very short) transcripts!**

* [Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) - "**Single Immutable State Tree**" through "**The Reducer Function**"
