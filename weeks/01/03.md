## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] What are the steps for DFS on a graph? 
- [x] What supporting data structure might you use for BFS and DFS, respectively?
- [x] What happens when you type in www.google.com and hit enter?
- [x] What is the difference between the memory heap and call stack in javascript?
- [x] What is one problem with programming languages that are fully single-threaded


## Study

### Algorithms

The most important thing to know about graphs is how we access elements within them. BSF and DFS are two classic search algorithms that we have already touched upon when talking about Trees.
> NB: Remember that Trees are a type of Graph, but Graphs are not a type of Tree

### Web

Up until now, the way our browser's work may have been a mystery. While you may understand the MVC framework of a website, understanding how "the internet" brings us to that website is a completely different topic. This great article will begin to break down the nitty-gritty of our browser requests!

### JavaScript

The "Event Loop" is an extremely unique feature of javascript, and one of the reasons why it is such a powerful client-side language. Philip Roberts is a Javacsript developer with only a few years of experience; he breaks down this concept in a fun and easy to understand presentation. 

Spend both today and tomorrow watching and understanding this video on the Event Loop:

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more fatures to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
