## Today's Learning Goals:

- [ ] How do we define a graph mathematically?
- [ ] What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
- [ ] Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)
- [ ] What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?
- [ ] What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of `N`
- [ ] Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).
- [ ] What are cycles?
- [ ] What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.  
- [ ] What are the three **primary** Fielding constraints? (Bonus if you can say who Fielding is!)
- [ ] What sub-constraints make up a **Uniform Interface**
- [ ] Walk through an arbitrary example of a RESTful request/response cycle, and describe _**what**_ makes it RESTful
- [ ] Give a high level overview of what an object's prototype represents
- [ ] What are the differences between the `__proto__` and `prototype` attributes?
- [ ] What happens when we **do** or **don't** explicity set an object's prototype?
- [ ] What is an object's **default** prototype?
- [ ] What are the valid values for an object's prototype?
- [ ] Name 5 benefits of HTML5
- [ ] What is `localStorage`? How might you use it?
- [ ] Why are media queries useful?
- [ ] What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.
