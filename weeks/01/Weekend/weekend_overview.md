## Weekend's Learning Goals:

- [ ] Explain the steps of Djikstra shortest-path algorithm.
- [ ] What is the time complexity of Djikstra's algorithm?
- [ ] What is a _datagram_?
- [ ] What are the benefits of UDP over TCP? What are the shortcomings?
- [ ] What is the risk we face when using `==` vs `===`?
- [ ] _When_ is the value of `this` evaluated?
- [ ] How does `use strict` affect the value of `this`?
- [ ] Without `use strict`, what is the value of `this` inside a named or anonymous function? 
- [ ] What is the value of `this` in method style syntax?


# 🚨 Study for then Weekly Assesment 🚨 
<!-- Todo: Figure out hackerrank thing -->
Welcome to the end of Week 1! The next step is to double down on what you've learned, and prepare for the HackerRank test that will be sent to your email address. 

## Practice

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. Practice for at least 30 minutes today.**

### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
