## Today's Learning Goals:

- Give a high level overview of an Adjacency Matrix
- If we were only concerned about time complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not? 
- If we were only concerned about space complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not?
- Give a high level overview of an Adjacency List
- What benefits do we get from an Adjacency List?
- What are the benefits of a Javascript closure?
- Formally define a Javascript closure
- Give an example of a closure
- What is **data encapsulation**?


## Practice

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. Practice with flashcards for at least 30 minutes each day.**


* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** Explain the different ways that graphs can be represented. What are the pros and cons of various ways of representing graphs.
* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** What does it mean to be RESTful?
* What's a closure? How are they used?
* Give a high level overview of how CSS grids work.

### Keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
