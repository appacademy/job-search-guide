## Today's Learning Goals:

- Give an example of a use-case for Topological Sort 
- What is a difference between Topological Sort and DFS?
- On which types of Graphs can we do a topological sort?
- What data structure do we use to assist with the topological sort algorithm?
- Explain TCP, and why it is a necessary protocol
- What's an IFFE? When would you use it?
- What is the syntax for an IIFE?
- What lifecycle methods get called in the update phase? What are the use cases for each of those methods? What method gets called in the unmounting phase?
- Give one explanation for why we have to make AJAX requests in `componentDidMount`

## Practice

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. Practice for at least 30 minutes today.**

### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
